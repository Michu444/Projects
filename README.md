# Partitions

The division of the number n is a representation of the sum of positive prime numbers such that n = n1 + n2 + ... + nr , where n1 >= n2 >= nr , r - index of last part.
    
**INPUT:** In the first line: the number of consecutive lines. In the following lines after a space: n and k where n is the number to decompose, and k is the prime number at which to begin the split.

**OUTPUT:** Partitions separated by + . ( if partition exist )

**EXAMPLE:** 


    Input

    3
    12 5
    7 3
    15 11


    Output:

    5+3+2+2
